# Shenmue Collection Tracker

## Overview
The **Shenmue Collection Tracker** is a lightweight, browser-based tool designed to help Shenmue 1 players track their progress in collecting Gacha Capsules, Cassettes, and Scrolls. The website saves your state locally using browser cookies, so your data remains safe unless you clear them.

## Website

## About
Iâ€™m [Eerie](https://linktr.ee/eeriegoesd). I created this lightweight website to help Shenmue players track their collections after finding no similar resource online.

## Future Plans
If the tool proves helpful, I can add support for Shenmue 2 and Shenmue 3. Feedback is always welcome.
